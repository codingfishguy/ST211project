This report analyses the 2012 Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey, a Dataset
focusing on people’s views towards LGBT people in the UK. The data were collected
through face-to-face interviews with adults in the UK, and contain many different
factors of interest, such as respondents’ age, gender, social class and more.

I analyse it to answer the following question; ‘what factors affect people’s views on
the rights of same sex marriages?’ This question is particularly relevant, as same sex
marriages do not possess the same rights as traditional marriages in many parts of
the world, and it has also been relatively recent since same sex marriages have
been allowed in England. Thus, investigating the factors that can cause certain
views to emerge is worth doing.

The analysis finds that variables such as people’s age, gender, frequency of religious
service attendance and happiness are significant predictors of responses to the
question of same sex marriage rights.
